Adventure is a text-based adventure game inspired by Dunnet, the game that ships with the Emacs text editor.

To play the game, compile all files with 'javac *.java' and run with 'java Main.java'.

This project was designed so that creating highly customizable levels was extremely easy. To do so, follow the example in Map.java. If you have difficulties, follow these steps:

1. Open Map.java
2. Create a new public static method, with the return type Room and no arguments.
3. Instantiate a Room object, and return it in the function.
4. Lastly, open Game.java, and add the level to the menu by editing the chooseLevel function.
